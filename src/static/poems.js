					I was born in the warmest desire, in the flame of the love of my kin;

					Every artist is drawn by the art and musicians are sang through their songs.

					Let the wind of the changes prevail.
					 
					It’s so hard for me being released when the boredom is people’s a vale.
					 
					I was born with the soul of the West where the winds are extremely fierce.
					But the love there’s aflame with the salt, and the lovers are being supreme.
					 
					I am thrown like a leaf on the wind, and I can’t reach desirable peace.
					The Creator with the heart of the shield, am apparently God’s masterpiece?
					 
					No one knows where to go, we burn out, we are lost until found ourselves.
					But I like to remain uncovered while the verve ooze inside through my veins.
