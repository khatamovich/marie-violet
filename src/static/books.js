			This is what will be written on the order pamphlets with the royal seal, when the Punishers will ruin innocent lives.

			But little Arabela is not yet familiar with either cruelty or betrayal. She believes in love and mother’s fairy tales; she sees prophetic dreams. The road lies before her; other people’s destinies fall into her hands; she is led by the ghosts of the past.

			She doesn’t recognise the melody yet, but one day she will certainly – definitely – sing this lullaby to the little heir of the big kingdom of strife.`,

			Those intrigues are buried under seven seals and dusted with decaying time.
			Everyone here is used to obeying strict rules and living according to traditions that they must put up with. But charming Eric Melton storms into a series of family affairs, challenges the established order and gives young Julia a taste of real life.

			What do the sealed envelopes and empty rooms of the family estate hide?
			Where do the mistakes of silence lead?

			And what choice does Julia have to make to understand what it means to be truly happy?`,

			Her past is full of ambiguity, and her future is empty. And only her lively, brave heart continues to beat in her chest when he looks at her from afar; when he touches her skin; when he whispers in her ear the words dedicated to her alone.
			To her alone. 

			She closes her eyes, inhales deeply her favourite scent of cinnamon and sweet oranges, and exhales. In front of her there is a frightening nothingness, shrouded in the darkness of a small, cold chamber.

			Did she abandon this God or never belong to him?`,

With gnarled hands and fingers like twisted roots, she ensnared unwary travellers, drawing them into her watery realm. Those who dared to meet her gaze found themselves rendered speechless by the abyss of her black eyes. A shadow of dread fell upon the village where she settled, for none could escape the clutches of her malevolent spirits.

			Yet amidst the darkness, one soul remained untouched by sorrow or fear – for it was Malada, who treaded fearlessly through the forest paths and by the mischievous swamps. ‘Beware the Wandering Lights, dear child,’ the folks cautioned, ‘Avert, avert your gaze from the white sheets that the treacherous spirit washes in the river!’
			
			Will fortune favour Malada this time, will it mend the scars of the past, or will the wounds remain unhealed?
